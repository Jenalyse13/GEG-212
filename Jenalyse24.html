        <h2>About This Map</h2>
        <p>The places you go are important and leave lasting memories. As someone not from New York City, this assignment brought up memories that led me to choosing these places. The first place is a pizzeria near Barclays center called Fini Pizza. Being a basketball player, sports have a special place in my heart and both my parents, and I being born in New York, New York teams hold near and dear to our hearts. My parents have been telling me about Patrick Ewing missing a finger roll in game seven against Reggie Miller and the Pacers. However, this commitment died down and was not brought back until recently by a teammate of mine who is a major fan of the New York Liberty which has led us going to games at Barclays Center and this pizzeria is right next to it and would be somewhere I would like to eat at next time I go for a game. Next is Paneorama Bakery & Pastry Shop. My grandfather lives in Queens and it is a place that we often visit. As one can imagine when we come down, they like to get specific things for us to enjoy; between food, games, and movies there is nothing the hold out on us and this bakery is somewhere we would walk to either get bread in the morning for breakfast or possibly a midafternoon dessert or cookies for after dinner. From the convenience of the bakery being just a walk away and how delicious their treats makes the bakery a favorite of my family and me. Next is the Staten Island Ferry terminal in Manhattan. Traveling made easy through the Staten Island Ferry and Staten Island connection to the other boroughs along with the Verrazzano bridge but to avoid the city traffic the ferry is a great way to get into the city and it comes with a view of the Statue of Liberty. I have ridden the ferry often for several reasons from trying to get to Penn station to get home, going to the Italian festival, Barclay’s Center, museums, and everything in between. With all these different travels, I associate the ferry, hence many of my memories include the Staten Island Ferry and even times when driving around the city, though I do not know many places often I can tell when I come close to the ferry. Lastly Battery Park. Battery Park is one of the first things one would see coming out of the ferry terminal and is experienced even outside of that. In 8th grade my class took a field trip to the Jewish Heritage Museum and then visited the park afterwards and it was beautiful. My friends and I took many pictures and for my boyfriend’s and my one-year anniversary he gave me a ring so the memories from the park are something I deeply cherish. Now sometimes when I get off the ferry, I look at that park and if I have time I like to walk around and look at the other people making memories. Sometimes it is quiet with little people around but other times it is lively, and it is not hard to see all the happy memories being created. </p>
        <p>This class has been amazing, and I have learned many things about mapping and the places that we go to and how they can all be looked at. I have learned that all the places you go or wish to go have special stories, history or pieces of information that can help one understand that particular place even more. From Norway to New York City, I have mapped the different areas and all they have to offer from buildings, parks, subway lines to hurricane evacuations zones things I did not even think to look for and I found it interesting. Being an Informational Systems major and this being an interest of mine I hope to continue using this resource and skills that I have gained from the class and keep exploring different, diverse areas of the world and trying to apply to a project or internship.</a>.</p>
